# PS2: Explanation and Prediction
## Projects information
- **Author**: Haowen Ji, Data Science, Class 2023, Duke Kunshan University
- **Instructor**: Prof. Luyao Zhang, Duke Kunshan University
- **Disclaimer**: Submissions to the Problem Set 2 for STATS201 Introduction to Machine Learning for Social Science, 2022 Autumn Term (Seven Week - Second) instructed by Prof. Luyao Zhang at Duke Kunshan University.
- **Acknowledgments**: I would like to thank Prof. Luyao Zhang for her instructions on STATS201 and thanks classmates for the inspiring discussions. 
- **Project Summary**: 1) *Explanation project:* NFT is getting more and more popular, but the amount of research related to the prediction of the value a NFT product is still small. This project focus on the research question that what are the hot topics in the NFT prediction field. This question is important since it can help further research find new attributes in prediction. This project is applied to eight literatures related to the NFT prediction topic. The machine learning methodology explanation is used in this project, especially, word cload and bigram are used for text analysis. The results shows some new high-frequency words and new relationship of keywords. This project contributes to the future research direction of NFT prediction. More research can be conducted based on the new high-frequency words.
*2)Prediction project:* Ethereum has a large market cap, while its price predictability is not much addressed in the published literature. Thus, this project focuses on the research question that how effetive is machine learning algorithmns in predicting Etherem open price. This project is applied to the Ethereum opening price from 2015 to 2021. The machine learning methodology prediction is used in this project. Linear regression and random forest regression are used as regression models. The result shows that linear regression has a good performance, which random forest regression is not efficient. This project contributes to the times series data prediction, especially in the Ethereum value prediction. More researches on more kinds of machine learning models and more features related to the price prediction can be conducted in the future.

- Description: from figure 1, it is obvious that the predicted result is very close to the real open price value. The result is evaluated by R2 score, which is 0.984. The R-squre determines the proportion of variance, which shows how well the data fit the regression mode(Chicco, Warrens, and Jurman 2021). The closer the r-squared value is to 1, the better the fit. Thus, the linear regression reached a high accuracy regarding the r-squared value.
